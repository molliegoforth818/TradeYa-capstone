# TradeYa! 
TradeYa! is an app where you can trade clothes with your friends with just a click! Users can login and see, edit and delete thier own clothing items, in addition to seeing all thier friends available items for trade. I had a blast creating this application for my Front End Capstone at Nashville Software School!
